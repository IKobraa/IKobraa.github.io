            <h1>Conway's Game of Life</h1>
            <p>
                Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway in 1970.
                It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, with no
                further input required. The game consists of a grid of cells, each of which can be in one of two
                states: alive or dead. In my implementation i allowed the user to color in the pixels that are alive
                before the game starts and even while the game is running.
            </p>
            <h2>Rules:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors survives.</li>
                <li>Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes a live cell.</li>
                <li>All other live cells die in the next generation, and all other dead cells remain dead.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The game's evolution advances in discrete time steps, with each generation being a reflection of the
                previous one. Despite its simple rules, Conway's Game of Life can exhibit complex and intricate patterns
                that have fascinated mathematicians, computer scientists, and enthusiasts alike. In the following picture 
                you can see some of these patterns.

                <h1>Exploring the Mandelbrot and Julia Sets</h1>
                <p>
                    Welcome to a journey into the mesmerizing world of fractals! On this page, we want to give you a concise explination about the
                    captivating beauty of the Mandelbrot and Julia sets, two remarkable fractal formations that have captured the
                    imagination of mathematicians, artists, and enthusiasts alike.
                </p>
                <h2>The Mandelbrot Set</h2>
                <p>
                    The Mandelbrot set is a complex mathematical structure that emerges from a seemingly simple iterative process. Imagine
                    picking any point c in the complex plane and repeatedly squaring it and adding
                    c to itself. The Mandelbrot set is the collection of all points
                    c for which this process remains boundedâ€”those that do not spiral off into infinity.
                    As you explore the Mandelbrot set, you'll encounter intricate patterns, spirals, and self-similar shapes at various
                    levels of magnification.
                </p>
                <h2>The Julia Set</h2>
                <p>
                    Similar to the Mandelbrot set, the Julia set is another fascinating fractal structure that arises from a slightly
                    different iterative process. Instead of exploring all points in the complex plane, the Julia set focuses on a fixed
                    complex number c. 
                    The points in the Julia set are those that remain bounded under the iteration process of repeatedly squaring and
                    adding c. Each unique
                    c value leads to a distinct Julia set, characterized by its own unique geometry and visual characteristics. Some Julia
                    sets exhibit spirals, while others form intricate webs or intricate basins of attraction.
